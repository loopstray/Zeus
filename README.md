Zeus
====

Zeus is a simple and colorful landing page for the web. It was built with a common 1-2-1 design structure to quickly and effectively get essential information across and present a strong call to action.

Originally designed for use by the <a href="http://knoxdevicelab.org">Knoxville Open Device Lab</a>.

Zeus is a basic template and best used as a launching platform, and as such it can be refined and improved in many ways. Here are a few ways you can help make Zeus better:

1. Browse open issues, comment on proposals, or report typos or alignment issues.
2. Fork the Zeus repo, make some changes and share what you create!
